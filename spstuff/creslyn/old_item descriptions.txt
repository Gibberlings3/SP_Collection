To use these items, once they are unzipped import them into your game with the Infinity Engine Editor (IEEP-get it at www.teambg.com, look in the tools section). Refer to the help files with IEEP on how to do this. All of them replace items in the game, some can be purchased (mostly at the bonus merchants), others will be found in the game.

1. A useful little weapon for any sword wielding fighter. 
*Freedom's Call - +5 longsword. Grants wielder immunity to MOST things that hinder movement while still allowing the effects of haste. Negative plane protection. Casts Improved Haste on wielder 2/day.
NOTE: This sword replaces the Harmonium Halberd on sale by the bonus merchant in the Adventurers Mart (wa2halb)

2. Powerful armor with some good protections built into it, but with the rather large drawback of being immune to just about every protective spell in the game.

NOTE: This armor replaces Balduran's Plate on sale by the bonus merchant in the Adventurers Mart (wa2plat)

4. Nothing more fun than running around lopping peoples heads off with a massive 2 handed axe. (no 2hand axe pics or animations so just used halberds ones).
