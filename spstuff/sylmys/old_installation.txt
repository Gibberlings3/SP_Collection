Note: Using this method you can only have one custom kit installed at a time.
For this installation you will need the Infinity Engine Editor Pro from www.teambg.com

Installation Instructions
1) Copy all non text files to your override directory.
2) For the next step you need to open Kitlist.2da with notepad. Scroll to the bottom and 
you should see the following:
32   Sylvan_Mysttic ***** ***** ***** CLABRN09  53           0x40000000	12
(Note I mispelled Mystic in the installation but it won't show up in the game so it isn't a big deal)
Now the next step is to run Infinity Engine Editor Pro, clicking on the Dialog.TLK Editor.
Type in Sylvan Mystic into the reference text field. Click on the write radio button, and then click
the write button. The program will give you a reference number.  Write that number down and 
replace the first two ***** under Sylvan_Mysttic with that number.  Here is an example what it might
look like:
32   Sylvan_Mysttic 74111 74111 ***** CLABRN09  53           0x40000000	12
Now use the Dialog.TLK Editor again but this time paste the contents of Kit Description.txt into the 
reference text field. Click on the write radio button, and then clickthe write button. The program 
will give you a reference number. Write that number down and replace the last ***** under 
Sylvan_Mysttic with that number.  Here is an example what it might look like:
32   Sylvan_Mysttic 74111 74111 74112 CLABRN09  53           0x40000000	12
Save the file and you are done.
3) This is a ranger kit and should appear under the Ranger class.  Also only Elves and Half Elves
can be Sylvan Mystics.
4) Enjoy the kit, if you have any questions email me at dburson@uplink.net
