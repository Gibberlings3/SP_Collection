    <div class="section">
<p>This is a collection of kits and an item pack from <a href="http://www.sorcerers.net/">Sorcerer's Place</a>. The mods were           originally in an older, harder-to-install format and I have converted them to use a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer and implemented several bugfixes. Item restrictions are also           applied dynamically, meaning that           the item restrictions for the Arcane Fist and Archer of Sylvanus   kits will be implemented across all items in the game, including           those added or altered by other mods.</p>
      <p>I did not create any of this content; credit for that goes to   Polar Bear, Drizzt1180, and Creslyn. Should you find any bugs or           problems with any of the components, I will be happy to hunt   them down and fix them. If you have a suggestion for improving the           mod, or to report bugs, please visit the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/">Gibberlings             Three forums</a>. </p>
      <p>The original documentation included with each component can be found in the subfolders, predicated with &quot;old_&quot; to           avoid confusion.    </p>

    <div class="section">
<p>Due to hard-coded limitations of the Infinity Engine, only a   limited number of kits can be installed for each class. The Darkest           Day mod fills all available slots and as such the kit components   of this mod will be incompatible. It is unlikely but possible that           the Arcane Fist, Sylvan Mystic, and Archer of Sylvanus kits may   cause some compatibility problems with mods that alter the Undead   Hunter,           Cleric of Talos, or Cleric of Helm kits due to some usability   hacks that were implemented for the item restrictions. It is recommended             that the kits be installed after other item and kit mods but   before tweak mods.</p>
      <p>The installation of the Archer of Sylvanus kit will allow all   druids to use bows and crossbows; similarly the Arcane Fist kit will           allow bards to wear mage robes. These are design compromises   necessitated to try and get the kits closer to the original author's   idea.    </p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">Modmerge</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Sorcerer's Place Collection for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-spstuff.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>spstuff</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-spstuff.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-spstuff.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The Sorcerer's Place Collection for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-spstuff</strong>, <strong>setup-spstuff.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>spstuff</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-spstuff.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-spstuff.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Sorcerer's Place Collection for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall spstuff in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-spstuff --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

Instead of being half-fighter and half-cleric like             a paladin, they become half-fighter and half-necromancer   instead.

After time they began to gain the ability to   cast spells. Like regular ninjas they have the ability to             specialize in all weapons that a regular thief can use.

      <p><strong> Archer of Sylvanus Half-Elven Druidic Kit, by Drizzt1180</strong><br />
        Please see the compatibility notes at the top of this document in regards to this kit. </p>
      <div>
        <p>ARCHER OF SYLVANUS: This type of druid is very unique in the   way that they primarily use bows for their weapons. The only other             melee weapon they can             use is a club. These types of druid have the ability to do   severe damage to a target. They can summon the spirits of animals, which               are used usually in defense, because of their extreme weakness   in melee combat. Only Half-Elves can be an Archer of Sylvanus.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - Gains +1 <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> with ranged weapons every three levels through level 21<br />
          - Summon Spirit Animal twice per day<br />
          - Called Shot at levels 4, 9, 14, and 19<br />

          - +15% Slashing, piercing, and crushing resistance<br />
          - Can gain mastery in short bows, longbows, and crossbows</p>
        <p>Disadvantages:<br />
          - Can only wear up to studded leather<br />
          - Can only be proficient with clubs<br />
          - Can only use clubs, bows, and crossbows</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Arcane Fist Bardic Kit, by Drizzt1180 <br />
      </strong>Please see the compatibility notes at the top of this   document in regards to this kit. The only way to make this kit was to           compromise and modify a bard kit. Unfortunately, the bard song   and pick pocketing bonuses are hard-coded. The thieving button is           disabled, though the character record will show pick pocketing   ability, and the bard song button is enabled though the bard song           has no effect. </p>
      <div>
        <p>ARCANE FIST: The Arcane Fists are an ancient order of wizards   in Faerun, and are seldom ever seen. They are not quite the masters of   unarmed             combat nor are they the masters of the arcane arts, but they   become a fearsome foe with the combination of both. They are taught at             an early age the skills required for unarmed combat and also   learn to wield mystical powers. They are typically loners, only             assembling in groups with their own kind, or in times of great   danger they will group up with &quot;outsiders&quot;. There are three             sects of The Arcane Fist: The Order of Light, Bakur's   Brotherhood, and Death's Law.</p>
        <p>Advantages:<br />
          - Fist damage per level:</p>

      <p><strong>Item Pack, by Creslyn<br />
      </strong>Creslyn created a number of items that originally replaced items sold by merchants scattered throughout the game. These items           are now dynamically added to the respective stores without overwriting the original items. There are six items:</p>
      <ul>

<p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for          more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding          hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players          get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's          work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission          from the author(s). </p>
      <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>

<p><strong>Version 11 - WIP, TBD</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A lot of improvements for the mod on EE games:
          <ul>
            <li>Kits now use Wisp's full EE conversion macro. The older   hack was failing to install kits correctly on EE games, e.g. it could   install the kits but then make them unselectable at the character   creation screen.</li>
            <li>Character conversion macro has been updated as well</li>
            <li>Aedan, our Italian translator,  redid the formatting for the English EE translation to better match the EE style</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Usability hacks for the EEs are substantially reduced. For   example, the hacks for the Archer of Sylvanus no longer borks item   usabilities for Dorn and other Blackguards. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Freedom's Call's free action no longer blocks its own haste ability, and it's actually in the store now</li>
        <li>Revamped Italian translation courtesy of Aedan. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 10 - July 9, 2013 </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added Russian translation (thanks subzero400)</li>
        <li>Updated French translation (thanks to the d'Oghmatiques)</li>
        <li>BGEE softcodes a lot of kit aspects, which were not being accounted for. This is now addressed.</li>
        <li>Prepped Creslyn's Item Pack so that it'll work when BG2EE is released</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 9 - November 24, 2012 </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixpack has clearly honed my bug-catching eye--so many minor   bugs were found and fixed that I haven't bothered to enumerate them.   Among the higher-visibility ones are items from Creslyn's item pack   letting through numerous effects that they were supposed to prevent, and   a lot of the Blade Master abilities only working partially due to   misordered effects.</li>
        <li>Now compatible with BGEE</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 8 - April 10, 2009 </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>WeiDU v210, README, VERSION updates </li>
        <li>Lowercasing and Linux distribution </li>
        <li>Giuseppe's Italian translation added </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 7 - September 18, 2006 </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added  icons for Blade Master, Death Knight, and Archer of Sylvanus abilities </li>
        <li>Extended kit ability tables to level 50 for better compatibility with mods            that remove XP caps </li>
        <li>Archer of Sylvanus and Sylvan Mystic can now be installed after Divine            Remix </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 6 - March 12, 2005 </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug where Arcane Fist would lose their fist upgrade after reloading. Among other things, this left them unable to             kill enemies. </li>
        <li>Made Sylvan Mystic kit friendlier for <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>-only installs. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 5 - February 11, 2005 </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Archer of Sylvanus can now place proficiency points in the appropriate weapon styles. </li>
        <li>Fixed bugs with newer versions of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> failing on the <acronym title="COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP">C_E_R</acronym> patching. </li>
        <li>Tightened up some of the patching code. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 4 -September 9, 2004</strong></p>

      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 2 - June 8, 2004</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Added German translation, courtesy of Jester.</li>
        <li> Changed to integer numbering system--future versions of the mod will be v3, v4, etc. </li>
        <li> Fixed issues with the Archer of Sylvanus being able to use bows and arrows.</li>
        <li> The items in Creslyn's Item Pack will now appear inline in a store's inventory rather than at the top. </li>
        <li> Items in Creslyn's Item Pack will also detect kit components better and adjust accordingly. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1.1.1 - May 16, 2004 </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Fixed some minor issues with Blade Master spells</li>

      <p><strong>Version 1.0.0 - February 11, 2004 </strong></p>
