Arcane Fist: The Arcane Fists are an ancient order of wizards in Faerun, and are seldom ever seen. They are not quite the masters of unarmed combat, and neither are they the masters of the arcane arts, but they become a fearsome foe with the combination of both. They are taught at an early age the skills required for unarmed combat and also learn to wield mystical powers. They usually are loners, only assembling in groups with their own kind, or in times of great danger, they will group up with "out siders". There are three sects of The Arcane Fist: The Order of Light, Bakur's Brotherhood, and Death's Law.
