Death Knight: A Death Knight is created when a fallen paladin dies. This is a very rare occurrence of resurrection. When this happens the newly Death Knight will become evil with many evil related abilities.

They gain necromancy spells instead of their regular priest spells, but these new spells become innate.

Disadvantages:
-Loose Turn Undead
-Evil Alignment
