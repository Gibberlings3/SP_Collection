During one of these wars he was accused of a foul crime by a group of abjurers, and following an extremely short trial was condemned to being imprisoned in the very bowels of the earth. Some months later it came to light that he had not committed any wrong, indeed that it had been a nameless necromancer who had performed the deeds for which Geirthan had been imprisoned. In a show of the greatest remorse, Henstraadt, the abjurer who had cast him into the depths, freed him and created for him this armor which would protect him from such a terrible fate ever recurring. As well as imbuing it with an immunity to his own area of specialty, he called in several favors to ensure that should Geirthan ever run into the necromancer who was the cause of his sorrow, he would not fall to the mage's death magics. What became of Geirthan or the necromancer is unknown, but Henstraadt was assassinated by his own associates but a few months afterwards for creating something they feared could lead to their own downfall.

They are not quite the masters of unarmed combat nor are they the masters of the arcane arts, but they become a fearsome foe with the combination of both. They are taught at an early age the skills required for unarmed combat and also learn to wield mystical powers.

There are three sects of The Arcane Fist: The Order of Light, Bakur's Brotherhood, and Death's Law.

- 10th level: Becomes immune to disease, slow and haste.
